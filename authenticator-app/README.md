```bash
# 1. Navigate to the authenticator-app directory
cd authenticator-app

# 2. Install dependencies

## Configuration

### Updating TOTP Secrets
The default secrets in `index.html` are:
- Admin: `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`
- Librarian: `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXQ`

**IMPORTANT**: These should match the secrets in your Supabase database. To update:

1. Query your secrets from Supabase:
```sql
SELECT role, secret FROM totp_secrets;
```

2. Update the `SECRETS` object in `index.html`:
```javascript
const SECRETS = {
    admin: 'YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET',
    librarian: 'YOUR_LIBRARIAN_SECRET'
};
```

3. Rebuild the app after changes

## Troubleshooting

### Android
- If Gradle sync fails, try: File > Invalidate Caches / Restart
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your phone
- Check that Android SDK is properly installed

### iOS
- If signing fails, check your Apple Developer account status
- Ensure device is trusted (Settings > General > Device Management)
- Try cleaning build folder: Product > Clean Build Folder

## Security Notes
- The secrets are stored in the app code (client-side)
- This is acceptable for TOTP as the algorithm is public
- Keep your secrets confidential and regenerate them if compromised
- The app works offline by design - no data is transmitted
